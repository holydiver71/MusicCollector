```instructions
All code generation for this project must follow these standards:

- Apply Microsoft C# coding style (naming, formatting, etc.)
- Refactor code to follow SOLID principles
- Add comments and documentation
- Ensure all code is covered by unit and e2e tests

These are not a one-off phase; they must be followed for all code and updates generated for the MusicCollector project.
```
